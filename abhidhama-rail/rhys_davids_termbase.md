# TF-IDF Vocabulary Analysis — Rhys Davids Translation

Generated **2026-06-04** · source: `en-1-rhys_davids.md` · **2,247 unique content terms** ranked.

This report answers two questions:

1. **Which words in this translation are most frequent here but rare in everyday English?**  
   → High TF-IDF score. These are the lexical signatures of the text.
2. **Which words appear in the text but are also very common in general English?**  
   → Low TF-IDF score. These look familiar but carry specialist meaning here.

---

## Methodology

**Term Frequency (TF)** — count of each word in the translation, normalised by total content-token count.
Frontmatter, verse markers (`^1-2`), numbers and markdown syntax are stripped before counting.

**Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)** — computed from the Reuters-21578 newswire corpus
(10,788 documents, ~1.3 M tokens) using sklearn's smooth IDF formula:
`idf(t) = log((1 + N) / (1 + df(t))) + 1`. Corpus maximum ≈ 9.59. Scale:

| IDF range | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| 1.0 – 1.5 | Function word — present in virtually every document |
| 1.5 – 3.0 | Common content word — high general-English frequency |
| 3.0 – 6.0 | Moderately rare — limited domain or register |
| 6.0 – 9.0 | Uncommon / archaic — rare in Reuters |
| 9.59 (max) | Absent from Reuters — domain-exclusive, coined, or Pāli |

**TF-IDF score** = TF × IDF × 10⁶ (scaled for readability).

**Colour bands** used in the table:

| Band | Score range | Interpretation |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 🔴 | ≥ 50,000 | Text-exclusive — word essentially does not exist outside this translation |
| 🟠 | 10,000 – 49,999 | Domain-specific — Buddhist / Abhidhamma vocabulary |
| 🟡 | 3,000 – 9,999 | Specialist register — unusual in general English |
| 🟢 | 500 – 2,999 | Moderately distinctive — identifiable domain presence |
| 🔵 | 50 – 499 | Moderately common — has general English presence |
| ⚪ | 0 – 49 | Universal / function word |

---

## Distribution by Band

| Band | Terms | % of vocabulary |
|------|-------|----------------|
| 🔴 extremely high — text-exclusive | 17 | 0.8% |
| 🟠 very high — domain-specific | 161 | 7.2% |
| 🟡 high — specialist register | 279 | 12.4% |
| 🟢 medium — moderately distinctive | 802 | 35.7% |
| 🔵 low — common in general English | 988 | 44.0% |
| ⚪ very low — function / universal word | 0 | 0.0% |

## Observations

### 1. Text-exclusive coinages dominate the top
The highest-scoring terms are overwhelmingly **Rhys Davids coinages** — Victorian English vocabulary pressed into service for Pāli Abhidhamma concepts.
Words like *self-collectedness*, *wieldiness*, *tractableness*, *pliancy* barely exist outside this translation, giving them near-maximum IDF.

### 2. Buddhist technical register
A tight cluster — *skandha*, *jhāna*, *āsava*, *supramundane*, *incorporeal* — forms the Buddhist technical register. These score extremely high because they belong to a specialist domain absent from general English, and they recur in every paragraph.

### 3. The 'falsely familiar' vocabulary problem
Rhys Davids consciously chose ordinary English words — *zest*, *ease*, *synergies*, *contact*, *feeling* — to avoid Pāli transliteration. These occupy a mid-tier TF-IDF band: very frequent here, but their IDF is moderate because they do have a general English presence. They look everyday but carry specialist meaning.

### 4. Repetition as structure inflates TF
The *Dhammasaṅgaṇī* is formally repetitive by design (Buddhist catechism). Every mental factor is defined with the same formula across hundreds of consciousness types. Even moderately rare words (*volition*, *mindfulness*, *concomitant*) achieve unusually high raw frequencies relative to any other English text of equivalent length.
